# Module 8
## Event and Incident Detection
- Security Mindset - the ability to evaluate risk and constanatly seek out and identify the potential or actual breach of a system, applicaiton, or data
### Classifying for safety
- public data - already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization
- private data - information that should be kept from the public
    - ex. e-mail addresses, employee identification numbers, and organization's research data
- sensitive data - information that must be protected from everyone that does not have authorized access
    - ex. PII, SPII, PHI like bank account numbers, usernames/passwords, SS #'s, passport numbers, and medical info
- confidential data - important for an organization's ongoing business operations and usually has limits on the # of people who have access
    - ex. might only be accessed by the signing of NDA's, like trade secrets, financial records, and sensitive government data

### A security event is only considered a security incident when an actual breach occurs

- Business continuity plan - a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption
  - goal: keep the business itself running
    - conduct a business impact analysis - focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions have on an org
    - identify, document, & implement steps to recover critical business functions&processes - actionable steps toward responding to a security event
    - organize a business continuity team - brings various members of the org together to help execute the plan (cybersecurity, IT, HR, comms & operations dept's)
    - conduct training for the business continuity team - considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during training

- Disaster recovery plan - allows an organization's security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful
    ransomware attack
  - goal: restore technology infrastructure
    - implementing recovery strategies to restore software
    - implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality
    - identifying apps and data that might be impaced after a security incident
        - ex. how to recover backups after an attack
