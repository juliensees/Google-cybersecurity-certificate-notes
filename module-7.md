# Module 7: Automate Cybersecurity Tasks With Python

## Python 
- main usage in cybersecurity is for short automated tasks: like sorting through logs and managing access control list (employee access), and also connect processes together (like delivering a file and notifying specific employees)
- can be used for log & malware analysis, intrusion detection, compliance checks, and network scanning
  ### Advantages
  - resembles human language (easy to read)
  - requires less code in general
  - has an extensive collection of built-in code that can be imported to perform tasks
    
#Python Script

-#- hash symbol indicates a comment - the programmer is describing their intention behind the code
    - common practice to start with a comment
  "# Print Hello Python"     ----- don't use quotes
   print ("Hello Python!")
    - print () -- outputs a specified object to the screen. so the initial hash (#) comment says what you want to do with the code, and the code below signifies the code to do that.
      
- Syntax - refers to the rules of the correct structure of programming language

##Python Environments
  - Notebooks - online environment for writing, storing, and running code (Jupyter Notebook & Google Colaboratory)
      - Code Cells - meant for writing and running code. has a "play" button
      - Markdown Cells - meant for describing code
  - IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - app for writing code, that gives editing help and error correction tools, uses gui
  - CLI (Command-Line Interface) - text based interface that can also run python
